  abstract = {Data analysis, statistical research, and teaching statistics have at least one thing in common: these activities all produce many files! There are data files, source code, figures, tables, prepared reports, and much more. Most of these files evolve over the course of a project and often need to be shared with others, for reading or edits, as a project unfolds. Without explicit and structured management, project organization can easily descend into chaos, taking time away from the primary work and reducing the quality of the final product. This unhappy result can be avoided by repurposing tools and workflows from the software development world, namely, distributed version control. This article describes the use of the version control system Git and and the hosting site GitHub for statistical and data scientific workflows. Special attention is given to projects that use the statistical language R and, optionally, R Markdown documents. Supplementary materials include an annotated set of links to step-by-step tutorials, real world examples, and other useful learning resources.},

  abstract = {Building energy simulation (BES) has been widely adopted for the investigation of building environmental and energy performance for different design and retrofit alternatives. Data-driven analytics is vital for interpreting and analyzing BES results to reveal trends and provide useful insights. However, seamless integration between BES and data-driven analytics current does not exist. This paper presents eplusr, an R package for conducting data-driven analytics with EnergyPlus. The R package is cross-platform and distributed using CRAN (The Comprehensive R Archive Network). With a data-centric design philosophy, the proposed framework focuses on better and more seamless integration between BES and datadriven analytics. It provides structured inputs/outputs format that can be easily piped into data analytics workflows. The R package also provides an infrastructure to bring portable and reusable computational environment for building energy modeling to facilitate reproducibility research.},

  abstract = {Computers are a central tool in the research process, enabling complex and large scale data analysis. As computer-based research has increased in complexity, so have the challenges of ensuring that this research is reproducible. To address this challenge, we review the concept of the research compendium as a solution for providing a standard and easily recognisable way for organising the digital materials of a research project to enable other researchers to inspect, reproduce, and extend the research. We investigate how the structure and tooling of software packages of the R programming language are being used to produce research compendia in a variety of disciplines. We also describe how software engineering tools and services are being used by researchers to streamline working with research compendia. Using real-world examples, we show how researchers can improve the reproducibility of their work using research compendia based on R packages and related tools.},
