As building energy simulation (BES) becomes more integral to many aspects of
architecture design and decision-making processes, computational reproducibility
has become increasingly important to researchers, designers and practitioners.
Lack of credibility in BES results due to a lack of reproducibility is widely
considered a problem by the energy modeling community.

This is a half-day hands-on workshop on reproducing building energy simulations
using R using a [research compendium](https://peerj.com/preprints/3192)
workflow. Participants gradually build up a research compendium through guided
hands-on R programming exercises.

There is a dedicated [guide](https://reprod-bes.hongyuanjia.me/) that should be
used along with this workshop.

## Schedule

This schedule budgets time for a 4-hour iteration of the workshop (1 PM to 5 PM).
